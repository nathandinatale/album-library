# Album Library Project

The project is a full-stack web application developed for Integrify's Fullstack Academy. It simulates an "album library" in which authenticated users (via Google Sign-In) can rent/return albums, and authorized administrators can add new albums to the database. It incorporates a MongoDB Atlas database to store user and album information, Express.js for the backend API and TypeScript/React for the frontend. Material UI was used for the front-end styling and Redux toolkit for state management. 

This was my first solo full-stack web application from scratch, and first time using a No-SQL database, and I learned a lot from this project!
